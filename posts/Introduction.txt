Introduction

<p>Welcome to my blog, I'm Marcus Molchany and I'm a software engineer. Recently my focus has shifted towards web development and this website is my first endeavor. Six months ago I read a blog post by Jennifer Dewalt called <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/46892312080/day-1-the-beginning">180 Websites in 180 Days</a> and it inspired me to start learning about web development and to make a website. It's been a few months of learning and hard work but this webpage is the working product.</p>
<p>This blog is an introspective look at how this page was started, where its headed and how to do it yourself!</p>
