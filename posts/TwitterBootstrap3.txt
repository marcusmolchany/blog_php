Twitter Bootstrap 3

<p>Twitter Bootstrap is a gift from the gods. In short, Twitter Bootstrap is an open source web front-end framework that makes common HTML elements look great, provides cross browser compatability and most importantly incorporates responsive design for viewing websites on the many different devices that exist today. It started as a project called Twitter Blueprint and grew internally as engineers started contributing heavily during a Hack Week. Since then it has been publicly released and maintained by the core contributors and open source community and has made it to the current version 3.0.</p>

<p>So what makes Bootstrap so great? With the growing trend in mobile devices and tablets people have an array of ways to visit the internet, all with <a href="http://learn.lyntonweb.com/hs-fs/hub/74005/file-271229544-png/mobile-screen-sizes-resized-600.png">different screen sizes </a>(from <a href="http://www.lyntonweb.com/inbound-marketing-blog/responsive-design-101-everything-you-need-to-know">Lyntonweb</a> who borrowed it from <a href="http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation-2013/">Open Signal</a>). Some web developers took the approach of making separate mobile and desktop websites (mobile.example.com vs example.com) but these usually lead to a limited version of the full website and typically a poor user experience. Bootstrap solved this issue by implementing a grid system in CSS. Whenever you add an HTML element you specify how many columns that item will take up. This allows for columns to stack when the screen size changes, ultimately allowing developers to make one version of their website for all devices and restoring peace to the universe. Try it out, this website was built on bootstrap, open it on any device or resize it on your computer and see how it reacts (non of which I did myself, huge shout out to everyone who contributes to Bootstrap).</p>

<p>Bootstrap also includes some custom components that are commonly used across the internet such as navbars, alerts, labels, badges and progress bars to make your life easier. Along with the custom HTML and CSS is some JavaScript to animate their components. Everything is incredibly well documented on their website with examples and matching code snippets. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Check it out</a>, the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> page is really awesome and even includes some templates for getting started (this website was based off of Offcanvas).</p>
